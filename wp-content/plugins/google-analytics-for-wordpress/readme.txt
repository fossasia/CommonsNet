= 5.4 =

Release Date: April 20th, 2015

* Enhancements:
    * Complete technical overhaul of the way settings are being stored. Switched to WP Settings API and added input validation and sanitation for several settings.

    1. Fix minor XSS issue where admins could XSS each other through an unescaped manual UA field.

    1. Fix un-authenticated change of the GA profile list, allowing the previous XSS to become a slightly bigger issue. Issues 2 and 3 combined lead to a [DREAD score](http://blog.sucuri.net/2015/03/understanding-wordpress-plugin-vulnerabilities.html) of 5.
* Other fixes:
    * Small code style improvements.
    * Throw an error and deactivate if either the PHP SPL or PHP filter libraries aren't loaded.

= 4.0.6 =
* Bugs fixed in this release:
	* Sanitizing relative URL's could go wrong on some blogs installed in subdirectories.

* New features in this release:
	* Added a simple check to see if the UA code, when entered manually, matches a basic pattern of UA-1234567-12.
	* Added integration with [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/) and [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/). The page cache is now automatically cleared after updating settings. Caching is recommended for all WordPress users, as faster page loads improve tracking reliability and W3 Total Cache is our recommended caching plugin.
	* Added the option to enter a manual location for ga.js, allowing you to host it locally should you wish to.
* Bugs fixed:
	* Fixed implementation of _anonymizeIp, it now correctly anonymizes IP's by setting [_gat._anonymizeIp](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gaJS/gaJSApi_gat.html#_gat._anonymizeIp).
	* Increased request timeout time for Google Analytics authentication from 10 to 20 seconds, for slow hosts (if this fixes it for you, your hosting is probably not really good, consider another WordPress host).
* Documentation fixes:
	* Added a note about profiles with the same UA code to the Analytics Profile selection.
	* The profile selection dropdown now shows the UA code after the profile name too.
	* Updated the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/screenshots/) and the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/faq/) for this plugin.

* Bugs fixed:
	* If you upgraded from before 4.0 to 4.0.2 you might have an empty value for ignore_userlevel in some edge cases, this is now fixed.
	* Custom search engines were loaded after trackPageview, this was wrong as shown [by these docs](http://code.google.com/intl/sr/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/asyncMigrationExamples.html#SearchEngines), now fixed.

= 4.0.2 =
* Old settings from versions below 4.0 are now properly sanitized and inherited (slaps forehead about simplicity of fix).

	* Added a filter for text-widgets, all links in those widgets are now tagged too.
